To compile scrabble.cpp, enter "make" in the command line

Please grade my Player.cpp, Game_Design.cpp, Player.h, Game_Design.h, 
Board.cpp, Makefile, README.md, Dictionary.cpp, Tile.h, Board.h, Dictionary.h, Move.cpp, Move.h, scrabble.cpp,
Trie.h, Trie.cpp, CPUL.h CPUL.cpp, CPUS.cpp, CPUS.h, CPU

I have changed some of the files in HW4, so they need to be regraded (such as Gamde_Design,Board,Dictionary)
